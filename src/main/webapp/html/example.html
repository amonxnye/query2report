	<h1>Sample Report(s)</h1>
	<p> Let's have following reporting use cases on the employees sample database to be addressed by Query2Report</p>
	<p> The demo is based on employees sample database available for MySQL database. More information about the content refer to <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/</a></p>
	<ul>
		<li> Distribution of employees by departments, by designations and further distribution based on gender  </li>
		<li> Employee hiring in the organization over the years </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Distribution of employees by departments, by designations and further distribution based on gender</h2>
	<p> Build a report with two sections and four elements, first section shows Pie chart of distribution of employees by department and a bar chart showing distribution by department by gender. The second section shows pie chart of employees by designation and a bar hart showing distribution by role by gender. To build such a report in Query2Report we must create report template consisting of two sections and each section having two elements. </p>
	<p> Click on <img src="images/NewReport.PNG"></img> and then click on <img src="images/AddRow.PNG"></img> button to create two rows in the report template then click on <img src="images/AddColumn.PNG"></img> on each row to create two columns per row </p>
	<p> Click on edit image <img src="images/EditElement.PNG"></img> available in the top section for report title and report description</p>
	<p> Click on edit image <img src="images/EditElement.PNG"></img> on the each of the elements, there will be a total of 4 elements created. For each element, provide required title, SQL Query to fetch data, Chart type as per the requirement and refresh interval inputs.
	 Refresh interval is default to -1 which means no automatic refresh, however you can click on the refresh icon to refresh each cel	l manually. But if you want auto refresh of any or all of the cells provide the refresh interval in seconds in this input.</p>
	 
	 <p> Once the element is defined, you can test the SQL Query using the <img src="images/TestElement.png"></img> button and then <img src="images/CloseEdit.PNG"></img> button to see the corresponding chart getting rendered with real data.
	 Once all the element defination is finalized, you can choose to save reports in either of <img src="images/PublicReport.PNG"></img> which means the report is available for all users or <img src="images/PersonalReport.PNG"></img> which means the report is available only to that user.
